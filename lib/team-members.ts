    bio: "Social change starts when we take the lead and start realizing there is more to life beyond ourselves. As a Mexican, the ethnicity with most immigrants in the United States, I felt there was a need for me to step outside my privilege and help educate people on immigration issues that my community is being affected on. There is a need for our society to realize that we live in an interconnected world. Being a global citizen involves empathizing, educating yourself and others, and raising awareness about the impact you make at a global scale. That's why I chose to direct PAC",

    bio: 'I chose to go to the moon and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard." This quote is from a speech given by President John F. Kennedy at Rice University (1962), and it is his famous challenge to the nation to achieve the goal of landing a man on the moon. I choose to be on PAC this semester to again challenge the nation - to challenge our beliefs and to grow past our biases and comfort; a challenge not to be on a particular side, but to come together as one nation comprised of many unique individuals.',

    bio: "I am a part of PAC because immigration is personal to me, it's my story. I grew up in Balcarce, Argentina, and at thirteen I decided to leave home and pursue a new life in the United States. After years of challenges and persistence, I earned a scholarship to Principia, and that experience taught me that we are not just citizens of one country but of a larger, connected world. I care about this conference because immigration is not just policy, it's indeed people, sacrifice, and hope. Through my journey and what I've learned at Principia, I've seen how diverse stories create understanding and community. This conference will show that empathy and connection can be strengthened with a new approach, one that listens to and values immigrant voices. That's why I'm part of PAC.",
